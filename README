About auto-aklog
================

The auto-aklog Kerberos extension will automatically renew your AFS
tokens when your Kerberos tickets are acquired or renewed. It is
recommended to use this plugin along with the Kerberos.app ticket
manager to avoid having to worry about keeing tickets or tokens up to
date.

Currently, auto-aklog will run "aklog" any time your default
credentials cache is renewed. To adjust which cells aklog acquires
tokens for, you can create a file called ~/.xlog which lists one cell
on each line.

============
