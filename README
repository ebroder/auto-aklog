About auto-aklog
================

The auto-aklog Kerberos extension will automatically renew your AFS
tokens when your Kerberos tickets are acquired or renewed. I recommend
using this plugin along with the Kerberos.app ticket manager to avoid
having to worry about keeping tickets or tokens up to date.

Currently, auto-aklog will test to see if you currently have
un-expired tokens. If you do, it will only re-acquire tokens from the
principal whose tokens you currently hold. If you have no tokens, it
will get tokens for your default credential cache.

============
Installation
============

To install the auto-aklog Kerberos extension:

Run::

    xcodebuild install DSTROOT=/

then edit /Library/Preferences/edu.mit.Kerberos. Under the
section labelled "[libdefaults]", add::

    login_logout_notification = "auto-aklog"
